# THIS LIBRARY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED IN FAVOR OF PUBNUB JS SDK V4

PubNub JS SDK V4 supports a listener pattern which has an identical behavior
to this library. 
https://www.pubnub.com/docs/javascript/api-reference-sdk-v4#listeners

See ```example.html``` for an example of how to create multiple subscribe callbacks using the new v4 library.


PubNub highly recommends migrating to v4 of the Javascript SDK.
